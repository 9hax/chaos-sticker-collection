Merge Request are Welcome! New Stickers, better versions, more cyber!

## Add Stickers

1. Fork the repository
2. Add images to `./images/` subfolder (descriptive names please!)

4. Create a merge request

Supported fields:

* Tags: `unicorns advertisement` (lower case)
* Title: `We Deploy Unicorns`
* Author: `Mrs. Unicorn <unicorn@example.com>`
* License: `CC0-1.0` ([SPDX](https://spdx.org/licenses/) format)

All fields are optional!

## Sticker File Formats

SVG, PDF, JPG, PNG, EPS, AI, SLA and TIF images are accepted. Vector graphics are always preferred.

If you have multiple image formats or components of a sticker, then encode the difference after a dot. Example:

* cool-unicorn.png
* cool-unicorn.text.svg
* cool-unicorn.path.svg

The update.py script creates a `*_preview.webp` preview file.

## Submit Guidlines

* Only submit stickers that are free for non-commercial use (at least)
* Prefer images rather then photos of stickers, those are better for printing.

## Karma

Give stars/karma points to the source repository if possible!
